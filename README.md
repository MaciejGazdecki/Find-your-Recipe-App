I will create a simple app using ES6, searching recipes from external API Food2Fork.com. I will use in this project ES6
together with Babel and WebPack. I created before html structure and CSS and on this project, any way Sass Webpack converter is adder. In this projekt I will focus to crete JS code.
This project will be written in Vanilla JS. No frameworks.
