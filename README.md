# Find-your-Recipe-App
This is a simple app where user can look for recipes  and save them. The data is fetched from external API Food2Fork.com. I used in this project Vanilla JS ES6 together with Babel and WebPack. I created before html structure and CSS and for this project,. In this projekt I focuses more on JavaScript to practise it. No frameworks were used. Only Vanilla JS
